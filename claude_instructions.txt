KataGo RAG implementation:

add to database: vector embeddings 

FIRST THINGS TO LOSE:
- value / policy lineup but high entropy
- value confidence / policy inconfidence

Potential entropy mid-late scaling factor:
e^entropy / # legal moves available


SHOULD KEEP:
- value / policy both unconfident 
-> High entropy on both
